# Jungle by Nico Hernandez

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 6.1 for purposes of teaching Rails by example. Given an incomplete and "buggy" starter code, I was tasked with fixing and troubleshooting said bugs. Following this, new features were implemented on the app, such as a new "Add Categories" page for the Admin view, and showing relevant order information (e.g. the orders placed, the user's email, the order number) after an order was made. Tests were created using Cypress to ensure validity.

## Setup

1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
2. Create `config/database.yml` by copying `config/database.example.yml`
3. Create `config/secrets.yml` by copying `config/secrets.example.yml`
4. Run `bin/rails db:reset` to create, load and seed db
5. Create .env file based on .env.example
6. Sign up for a Stripe account
7. Put Stripe (test) keys into appropriate .env vars
8. Run `bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0` to start the server

## Database

If Rails is complaining about authentication to the database, uncomment the user and password fields from `config/database.yml` in the development and test sections, and replace if necessary the user and password `development` to an existing database user.

## Stripe Testing

Use Credit Card # 4111 1111 1111 1111 for testing success scenarios.
